# Data Science - Unit 2 | BloomTech

Unit 2 is about Predictive Modeling (also known as supervised machine learning), with labeled, tabular data. You will learn how to predict continuous and discrete values, using various regression and classification models respectively. You will focus on the entire Machine Learning Workflow - Data Wrangling, Splitting Data, Establishing Baseline, Building Models, Checking Metrics, Model Tuning & Results Communication.

## Learning Objectives

### Sprint 5	
- Understand and interpret various regression models
- Use scikit-learn to fit those regression models
- Learn the importance of baselines in regression and classification respectively
- Implement train-test-validation split
- Revisit Bias-Variance tradeoff, and define overfitting & underfitting
- Implement one-hot-encoding of categorical features
- Use scikit-learn pipelines

### Sprint 6	
- Use scikit-learn to fit decision trees and random forests
- Implement ordinal encoding for high-cardinality categorical features
- Understand overfitting and feature importances in tree-based models
- Implement cross-validation, and use scikit-learn for hyperparameter optimization
- Build and interpret confusion matrix for classification models
- Use the following classification metrics - precision & recall
- Understand relationships between precision, recall, thresholds and predicted probabilities

### Sprint 7	
- Use the ROC AUC classification metric
- Choosing a target and avoiding leakage of information
- Explore and join relational data for supervised learning
- Get permutation importances for model interpretation and feature selection
- Use xgboost for gradient boosting
- Visualize and interpret Partial Dependence & Shapley value plots
- ACS 2	
- Review and completion of Sprint Challenges / Assessments
